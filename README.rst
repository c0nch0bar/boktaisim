This program utilizes the free weather API provided by https://www.metaweather.com/ (built by Jason_
from Potato_) and would not be possible without it.

Weather icons were taken from `Font Awesome`_, with some adaptions.

Because of difficulties with packaging on Mac, this program includes a copy of `zipcodes.db` from
the `pyzipcode project`_.
